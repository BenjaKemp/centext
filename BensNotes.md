i've tried to stick to the brief as best as possible, two things that immediately stuck out was the lack of a eslint file and 
o testing suite - I wouldn't choose to submit my work without a decent set of tests, but perhaps the testing types you want
is something we can discuss at a later date

Secondly, the ESLint command doesnâ€™t work, and so we're relying on tsconfig.json alone. Without ESLint, the codebase might become prone to issues that TypeScript alone cannot catch.

Some of the files i've created are overkill a small project but I thinks its important to think about scalability, I believe that
this design scales well but could defo be more concise for what it is right now, just letting you know it was a choice!

I've spent some more time thinking of ways to better filter the applications since this is crucial in real world date - I can think of one edge case, if spend filter decreases then its not necessary to filter all applications again, we can just refilter the filtered apps
